            <h1 class="center">Early Years</h1>
            <p>I was born January 27, 1994 in the city of Waupaca, WI. Amherst, the town I grew up in, was just 15 minutes away. I spent most of my childhood with my brothers. They were my first friends and I, being the youngest, always wanted to do what they were doing. We spent our time playing the original xbox and going on adventures in our backyard.</p>
            <p>Through elementary school, I was involved in cub scouts. This is where my passion for the outdoors started. I would spend weekends with my boy scout troop at various outings. We learned basic survival skills, leadership, and a general appreciation for the outdoors. This is also where I got my first
            interest in the military.</p>

            <h1 class="center">Middle Years</h1>
            <p>Middle school is when I found my passion for IT. Most of my friends were like-minded and we were always trying to stay up-to-date with the latest technology. My friends got me interested in IT which thankfully led me to pursue this field.</p>
            <p>I spent most of my time in middle school and early high school either studying, working, or gaming. My friends and I would spend a lot of weekends together. During this time I also built my first PC, furthering my interest in the IT field.</p>

            <h1 class="center">To Present</h1>
            <p>Most of my time in high school was also spent studying and working. In the summer before my senior year, I enlisted in the US Navy Reserve to serve as a medic with the Marine Corps. I was looking for adventure and an experience outside of the small town I had been in my whole life. It was a great experience. I graduated highschool early and was two weeks away from graduating bootcamp as the rest of my high school class was graduating.
            I learned countless transferable skills which I will carry with me the rest of my life. My contract recently expired and I left the Military as a Second Class Petty Officer(E-5).</p>
            <p>Now I am working part time and focusing almost all of my time on school. I have just one semester left and I am very excited to join the workforce as a developer.</p>
